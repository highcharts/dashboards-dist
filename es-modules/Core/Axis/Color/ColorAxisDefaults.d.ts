import type ColorAxis from './ColorAxis';
/**
 * A color axis for series. Visually, the color
 * axis will appear as a gradient or as separate items inside the
 * legend, depending on whether the axis is scalar or based on data
 * classes.
 *
 * For supported color formats, see the
 * [docs article about colors](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/colors).
 *
 * A scalar color axis is represented by a gradient. The colors either
 * range between the [minColor](#colorAxis.minColor) and the
 * [maxColor](#colorAxis.maxColor), or for more fine grained control the
 * colors can be defined in [stops](#colorAxis.stops). Often times, the
 * color axis needs to be adjusted to get the right color spread for the
 * data. In addition to stops, consider using a logarithmic
 * [axis type](#colorAxis.type), or setting [min](#colorAxis.min) and
 * [max](#colorAxis.max) to avoid the colors being determined by
 * outliers.
 *
 * When [dataClasses](#colorAxis.dataClasses) are used, the ranges are
 * subdivided into separate classes like categories based on their
 * values. This can be used for ranges between two values, but also for
 * a true category. However, when your data is categorized, it may be as
 * convenient to add each category to a separate series.
 *
 * Color axis does not work with: `sankey`, `sunburst`, `dependencywheel`,
 * `networkgraph`, `wordcloud`, `venn`, `gauge` and `solidgauge` series
 * types.
 *
 * Since v7.2.0 `colorAxis` can also be an array of options objects.
 *
 * See [the Axis object](/class-reference/Highcharts.Axis) for
 * programmatic access to the axis.
